# AGV (Using RFID)

# Problem:
   Automatic material handling in fabrication department.
  --> Reduce manual work in material travelling chain and reach required material at right place and right time.
  --> Reduce worker movement in fabrication shop.
  --> Reduce manual work and increase efficiency and accuracy.
  
# Modules I have used:
   Arduino 
  --> NodeMCU
  --> MotorShield 
  --> RF modelu 
  --> RFID Reader and Tags
  --> DC motor
  --> IR sensor
  
# What will happen?
    When there will be any requirement or need to move the material from one place to particular destination, AGV will move from its current position to that point from where the request was originated.
    After reaching to the point, AGV will handle the material task defined with procedure and delivered it to the particular destination that was defined at the time of request.
